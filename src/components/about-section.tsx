              Iâ€™m a recent Computer Engineering graduate who discovered that coding is a lot like lifeâ€”you break things, fix them, and then act like you knew what you were doing all along ðŸ˜…. My journey has been a mix of late-night debugging marathons, tiny victories that felt huge, and learning that caffeine and curiosity are a developerâ€™s best friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              ðŸŒ± Over time, I realized that growth isnâ€™t just about writing better code but also about building consistency, habits, and communities. From mentoring peers to experimenting with new ideas, Iâ€™ve enjoyed turning challenges into stepping stones.
            </p>
            <p>
             âœ¨ Today, I see myself as someone who loves solving problems, learning fast, and adding a little creativity (and sometimes humor) into everything I do. My next adventure? Joining a dynamic team where I can keep growingâ€”without breaking too many things on production.
