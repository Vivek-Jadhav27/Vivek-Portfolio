## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, techy blue (#72BCD4), aligning with a modern and clean design and a tech vibe. The user wanted green, so here is an analogous hue that still delivers the requested feeling, without feeling too strongly like a plant/nature portfolio.
- Background color: Light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF), creating a clean, modern look. Almost the same hue as the primary, just desaturated to about 20% saturation and made quite bright.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#9FA8DA) for interactive elements and highlights, maintaining a professional look. The accent is a different brightness from the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern aesthetic. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Responsive design implemented using TailwindCSS for optimal viewing across devices.
- Use scrollable navigation for easy access to all sections of the portfolio.
